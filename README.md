# Java-Challenges-Week-3
Created for Promineo Tech Java coding challenges. The most enjoyable one to figure out was how to make the outline of a square using print statements, 
as it forced me to deal with nested loops (something I often struggle with). I intend to figure out a way to draw different shapes in time.
